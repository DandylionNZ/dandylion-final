Strategy doesn’t need to feel heavy.

At its best, strategy is a tool for **better decisions**: what to focus on, what to stop, and what will move the needle most.

At Dandylion Strategy, we work with leaders who want:
- clarity over complexity  
- decisions over documents  
- momentum without noise  

If you’re building something meaningful and want the next step to feel clear, you’re in the right place.
