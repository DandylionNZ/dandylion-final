Most strategies fail for one boring reason: they don’t connect to the way work actually happens.

They’re ambitious, well written, beautifully formatted — and then quietly ignored.

It’s not because people don’t care. It’s because the strategy doesn’t answer the questions leaders and teams are forced to answer every day:

- What are we doing less of?
- What is changing this quarter?
- Who is accountable for what?
- How will we know it’s working?

### The difference between strategy and a wish list
A wish list is additive. It collects ideas without trade-offs.

Strategy is selective. It makes clear choices and creates alignment.

If your strategy contains ten priorities, you have none. People will default to the urgent, the loud, or the familiar.

### A practical structure that holds up
When I’m helping organisations shape strategy, I look for five things:

**1) A clear problem definition**  
What is the friction we’re solving? What has changed?

**2) A small set of choices**  
The choices should be uncomfortable enough to be real.

**3) A sequence**  
What comes first, second, and third — and why.

**4) Measures that reflect reality**  
Not just outputs (“we delivered X”), but indicators that show direction.

**5) A communication plan that supports the strategy**  
How will you explain the choices, reinforce them, and keep people aligned when pressure hits?

### If you want one test
Ask a team leader to explain the strategy in their own words.

If they can’t, it’s not their fault — the strategy isn’t usable yet.

Good strategy reads like clarity. It feels like relief.
