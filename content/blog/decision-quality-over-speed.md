There’s a quiet pressure in leadership roles to be fast. Quick responses, quick plans, quick confidence.

Speed matters. But in complex environments, **decision quality** matters more.

I’ve seen organisations move quickly and still lose months — because the decision was made without clarity on what problem was being solved, who needed to be involved, or what “good” looked like. The rework is where the time disappears.

### A simple way to lift decision quality
When the stakes are high (or the situation is messy), pause long enough to answer three questions:

**1) What are we actually deciding?**  
Not “what should we do”, but the real decision in plain language.  
Example: “Are we prioritising cost reduction or service reliability for the next quarter?”

**2) What would make this a good decision six months from now?**  
Define the success conditions before you choose.  
Otherwise you’ll judge the decision by emotion or noise.

**3) Who holds information we don’t have?**  
Not “who should approve this”, but who can reduce uncertainty:
- customers or frontline staff
- finance or legal
- delivery teams
- external partners

You don’t need everyone in the room. You need the right inputs before the call.

### A note on confidence
Confidence doesn’t come from certainty — it comes from process.

When you can say “we were clear on the decision, we tested assumptions, and we understood the trade-offs”, you can stand behind the outcome even if circumstances change.

That’s what good strategy looks like in practice: fewer rushed decisions that create long clean-ups later.
