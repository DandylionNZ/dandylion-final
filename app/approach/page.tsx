          A considered approach to complex decisions
        </h2>

        <p>
          Good strategy isn’t about having the loudest ideas or the most
          frameworks. It’s about asking the right questions, understanding
          context, and exercising sound judgement.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Dandylion Strategy, our approach is grounded, thoughtful, and
          deliberately calm — particularly when situations feel uncertain or
          high-stakes.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">We start with clarity</h3>
        <p>
          Before jumping to solutions, we take time to understand what’s really
          happening, what decisions need to be made, what constraints exist, and
          what success actually looks like.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">We work alongside leaders</h3>
        <p>
          Our work is collaborative and closely connected to leadership teams,
          bringing structure, perspective, and independent thinking without
          overriding internal expertise.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">We value judgement over templates</h3>
        <p>
          Rather than applying pre-set models, we tailor our thinking to your
          context and focus on what will hold up in practice.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">We focus on decisions, not documents</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of our work isn’t a report — it’s confident decision-making
          that can be explained, defended, and delivered.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">A trusted partner, when it matters</h3>
        <p>
          We’re often engaged during moments of change, scrutiny, or uncertainty
          — helping bring order to complexity and confidence to direction.
