          Clear thinking, grounded advice
        </h2>

        <p className="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed">
          Dandylion Strategy exists to support organisations when decisions
          matter — particularly when complexity, change, or scrutiny make
          direction harder to see.
        </p>

        <p className="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed">
          The work is grounded in the belief that good strategy is not about
          noise, speed, or scale. It’s about judgement, context, and making
          decisions that stand up over time.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">An independent perspective</h3>
        <p className="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed">
          We provide an independent, considered perspective — helping leaders
          step back, see situations more clearly, and move forward with
          confidence.
        </p>

        <p className="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed">
          Our role is not to replace internal expertise, but to support it —
          bringing structure, clarity, and calm thinking where it’s most needed.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Experience across strategy and communications</h3>
        <p className="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed">
          The work sits at the intersection of strategy, communications, and
          leadership decision-making. This allows us to support not just what an
          organisation decides, but how those decisions are understood,
          communicated, and carried forward.
        </p>

        <p className="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed">
          This perspective is particularly valuable during periods of change,
          growth, or public attention — when clarity and credibility matter.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">How we show up</h3>
        <p className="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed">
          We work in a grounded, collaborative way. Thoughtful rather than
          performative. Practical rather than theoretical.
        </p>

        <p className="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed">
          We’re deliberate about staying focused on what matters most, helping
          leaders navigate complexity without adding to it.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Who this is for</h3>
        <p className="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed">
          Dandylion Strategy works best with organisations that value clarity,
          sound judgement, and thoughtful decision-making — and who are looking
          for support that reflects that.
